Create a new git repo

You could start writing code now and throw it all away when you're done. If you'd rather preserve your work under source control, consider taking the following steps.

Initialize this project as a local git repo and make the first commit:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a remote repository for this project on the service of your choice.

Grab its address (e.g. https://github.com/<my-org>/my-proj.git) and push the local repo to the remote.

git remote add origin <repo-address>
git remote add origin https://github.com/hsyh/thefinder.git

git push -u origin master
